# LeetCode Best Time to Sell and Buy Stock

This repository contains a C++ solution for the "Best Time to Sell and Buy Stock" question on LeetCode. The provided solution utilizes a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock.

## Problem Description

The problem is to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a single stock on a given array of stock prices. The goal is to buy the stock at a lower price and sell it at a higher price to maximize the profit.

## Solution Approach

This repository provides a C++ solution approach to solve the "Best Time to Sell and Buy Stock" problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming**: The provided C++ code iterates through the array of stock prices while maintaining the minimum price encountered so far. It calculates the profit that can be obtained by selling the stock on the current day, considering the difference between the current price and the minimum price. The maximum profit is updated whenever a higher profit is found.
